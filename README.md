## Profile

I apply Python-based analytical methods to **financial data, risk measurement, and behavioural analysis**.  
My work focuses on **time-series modelling**, **portfolio risk**, and **decision-related dynamics**, with an emphasis on clear assumptions, empirical grounding, and reproducible analysis.

This GitHub repository contains **applied analytical projects**, developed as standalone studies rather than instructional material.
